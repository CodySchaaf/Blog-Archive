Hi! 
My name is Cody Schaaf. 
I’m a web developer, game maker, and technology enthusiast.  
I spend most of my time these days bouncing between different javascript libraries, Rails, and Scala, but I’m pretty language agnostic.
My specialties at the moment are AngularJs and Scala.
I enjoy nothing more than learning new languages and frameworks.  Feel free to contact me with questions/comments/anything.
